Sure! Here is a detailed guide to help you get started with building a network using Python and NetworkX to simulate complex data pipelines. This guide will cover installations, creating directed graphs, and generating source-to-target tables along with levels, predecessors, and successors.

## Building a Network Using Python and NetworkX

### 1. Installations

First, you need to install the necessary libraries. You can do this using pip:

```sh
pip install networkx matplotlib pandas
```

### 2. Importing Libraries

Start by importing the required libraries:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
```

### 3. Creating a Directed Graph

Create a directed graph to simulate your data pipeline:

```python
# Create a directed graph
G = nx.DiGraph()

# Add nodes (tables) and edges (relationships)
G.add_edge("Table_A", "Table_B")
G.add_edge("Table_A", "Table_C")
G.add_edge("Table_B", "Table_D")
G.add_edge("Table_C", "Table_D")
G.add_edge("Table_D", "Table_E")

# You can add more nodes and edges as per your requirement
```

### 4. Visualizing the Graph

Visualize the graph to see the structure of your data pipeline:

```python
# Draw the graph
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, node_size=3000, node_color="skyblue", font_size=15, font_weight="bold", arrowsize=20)
plt.title("Data Pipeline Graph")
plt.show()
```

### 5. Generating Source to Target Tables

Create a DataFrame to represent the source to target relationships:

```python
# Get edges as a DataFrame
edges_df = pd.DataFrame(G.edges(), columns=["Source", "Target"])
print(edges_df)
```

### 6. Determining Levels of Nodes

Calculate the level of each node in the graph:

```python
# Function to determine the level of each node
def get_node_levels(G):
    levels = {}
    for node in nx.topological_sort(G):
        preds = list(G.predecessors(node))
        if preds:
            levels[node] = 1 + max(levels[p] for p in preds)
        else:
            levels[node] = 0
    return levels

# Get levels of nodes
levels = get_node_levels(G)
levels_df = pd.DataFrame(list(levels.items()), columns=["Node", "Level"])
print(levels_df)
```

### 7. Finding Predecessors and Successors

Get predecessors and successors for each node:

```python
# Get predecessors and successors
predecessors = {node: list(G.predecessors(node)) for node in G.nodes()}
successors = {node: list(G.successors(node)) for node in G.nodes()}

# Convert to DataFrames
pred_df = pd.DataFrame(list(predecessors.items()), columns=["Node", "Predecessors"])
succ_df = pd.DataFrame(list(successors.items()), columns=["Node", "Successors"])

# Merge all information
node_info_df = levels_df.merge(pred_df, on="Node").merge(succ_df, on="Node")
print(node_info_df)
```

### 8. Putting It All Together

Combine all the data into a single DataFrame for easy analysis:

```python
# Combine edges, levels, predecessors, and successors
full_info_df = edges_df.merge(node_info_df, left_on="Target", right_on="Node", how="left").drop(columns=["Node"])
print(full_info_df)
```

### 9. Saving the Data

Save the data to a CSV file for further analysis:

```python
# Save DataFrame to CSV
full_info_df.to_csv("data_pipeline_info.csv", index=False)
```

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can build a comprehensive network simulation of your data pipelines using Python and NetworkX. You can expand this guide by adding more complex logic, additional attributes to nodes and edges, and further analysis as required.

Happy coding and have a great flight!
